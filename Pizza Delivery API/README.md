Pizza Delivery API


The Pizza Delivery API is a RESTful API service designed to streamline the ordering and delivery process for a pizza shop. This project provides backend functionality for handling orders, managing menu items, tracking delivery status, and processing payments. With a clean and efficient API design, this project is ideal for integration with front-end applications or mobile apps to create a complete pizza ordering system.

üçï Project Overview

This API allows users to browse a pizza menu, place orders, customize their selections, and track delivery statuses. Built with scalability and modularity in mind, this API can be expanded to support additional features, making it suitable for small-to-medium-sized pizza shops looking to implement online ordering.

‚ú® Features
Menu Management: Retrieve a list of available pizzas and their details, such as ingredients, price, and size options.
Order Placement: Users can place orders by selecting from the menu and customizing their pizzas.
Order Tracking: Real-time tracking of order status, from preparation to delivery.
Payment Processing: Secure payment integration for seamless transactions (can be connected to a payment gateway).
User Authentication: Allows users to create accounts, log in, and manage their orders.


üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Backend: Node.js and Express.js for handling API requests and managing business logic.
Database: MongoDB for storing user, menu, and order information.
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
Environment Variables: Used to securely store sensitive information, such as database URI and API keys.


üèóÔ∏è API Endpoints

The Pizza Delivery API offers the following main endpoints:

Menu Endpoints:

GET /menu - Retrieve a list of all available pizzas.
GET /menu/:id - Retrieve details of a specific pizza.

üìñ How It Works

Menu Retrieval: Users can browse the menu to see the available pizzas, their descriptions, and prices.
Order Process: Authenticated users can place an order by selecting items from the menu and providing necessary details.
Order Management: Once an order is placed, the backend tracks the status, allowing users to monitor their order's progress.
Authentication: Ensures secure access to order history and personal information, allowing only authorized actions.
